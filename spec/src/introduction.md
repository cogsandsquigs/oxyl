Welcome!

This is the specification for [Oxyl](https://github.com/cogsandsquigs/oxyl), my (very very) silly programming language.

Oxyl is designed to be:

- Readable
- Functional
- Multi-purpose
- Safe
- Effective

However, it is also a silly side-project of mine. So, of course, stupid things will happen.
